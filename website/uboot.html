<p>Bootloader is a first program executed by ARM processor after boot
occures. It is located in the FLASH memory, so replacing operation might
be quite dangerous one. In case of any failure, while this operation
is in progress device might become unfunctional. We recomend to have
a JTAG software and hardware to be able reload new copy of loader if
other replacing method fails.
</p>
<p>Just a simple explanation of JTAG here. Hardwired connection to
development board is able to place any data in a FLASH memory while
XScale processor is stopped. It is slow operation so use it only
if your bootloader is not able to reflash itself or something went
wrong before reflash operation.
</p>
<h4>Building instructions</h4>
<p>Because U-Boot <a href="ftp://ftp.denx.de/pub/u-boot/u-boot-0.4.5.tar.bz2">source tarball</a> contains also some utilities for
debugging you need to have GDB package installed (developer version
if you use binary Linux distribution), otherwise compilation fails.
</p>
Extract sources
<pre>
  tar xjf u-boot-0.4.5.tar.bz2
</pre>
enter u-boot directory
<pre>
  cd u-boot-0.4.5
</pre>
To prepare U-Boot sources for WEP configuration type and building type
<pre>
  make wepep250_config
  make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-
</pre>
You may see here "arm-linux-" is prefix to cross compiler to use. Also
you may found file 'tools/mkimage', that is used to create U-Boot suitable
kernel files. 'u-boot.bin' is special type of executable file (memory image),
that might be flashed to WEP using <a href="http://openwince.sourceforge.net/jtag/">JTAG Tools</a>.
<h4>Simple U-Boot help instructions</h4>
<p>U-Boot is talking on BTUART with speed 115200 baud with no HW control. You may need
to use kermit or minicom software and serial cable if you want to use U-Boot
command line oriented environment. Kernel image should be located on address
40000 and JFFS2 filesystem on address 200000.
</p>
Basic commands
<ul>
<li><pre>erase</pre>Erases flash memory by sectors. WEP has 256kB sector size
in current configuration.<pre>erase 1:1-127</pre> erases all but bootloader memory</li>
<li><pre>loadb</pre>Loads binary data into memory over serial line using kermit protocol.
This commmand is strictly RAM oriented, so do not use it to load data into FLASH memory.</li>
<li><pre>cp</pre>Copy command. Most usefull is using this commmand to fill FLASH memory like
<pre>loadb a1001000;cp.b a1001000 40000 180000</pre>This will load kernel image into SDRAM
and later to copy into FLASH from 'a1001000' address to '40000' address and size of '180000'.
As you might notice suffix '.b' was used, so size parameter is interpreted in bytes.</li>
<li><pre>bootm</pre>Booting stored image. As parameter you have to use address of image
in memory so<pre>bootm 40000</pre> will boot stored image in FLASH memory</li>
<li><pre>protect</pre>Software protection of memory. U-Boot is set to protect first
FLASH memory sector (its own sector) by default. So if you decide to replace booter
by U-Boot use this to unprotect area of booter. Be sure you have a <a href="http://openwince.sourceforge.net/jtag/">JTAG Tools</a> to reflash
booter memory if flashing operation fails.</li>
</ul>
<p>U-Boot is a powerfull booter with many nice features, that might be optionally compiled in.
Such as JFFS2 reading and booting ability, integrated environment etc. Default settings
for WEP platform presented in sources in 0.4.5 version, is to use U-Boot for simple
booting monilitic kernels only. Feel free to send us your patches.
