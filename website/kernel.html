<p>Even ARM proccessor support is located in all current kernel versions, to find out last
changes visit <a href="http://arm.linux.org.uk">ARM Linux Homepage</a>.
Our patch is currently based on
<a href="ftp://ftp.arm.linux.org.uk/pub/armlinux/source/kernel-patches/v2.4/patch-2.4.19-rmk7.bz2">patch-2.4.19-rmk7.bz2</a>
WEP platform is based on Intel XScale ARM processor, so also visit Monta Vista kernel 
for <a href="ftp://source.mvista.com/pub/xscale/pxa/diff-2.4.19-rmk7-pxa1.gz">diff-2.4.19-rmk7-pxa1.gz</a> file.
Patches created by ARM crew, namely Mr. Russel King as coordinator, are named
patch-2.4.19-rmkX. The X is number of patch release (greater is newer) to
vanilla kernel from <a href="http://www.kernel.org">www.kernel.org</a>.
Monta Vista kernel patches are named diff-2.4.19-rmkX-pxaY, so X defines RMK patch
this diff refers to and Y is version number of current pxa patch. Actually our
patch is naming conventions uses the same notation - patch-2.4.19-rmkX-pxaY-wepZ.
</p>
<p>To get real patched sources ready for WEP platform, download vanilla kernel, use patch
from ARM Linux of MR.King, use pxa patch from MontaVista and finally use our special
WEP patch.
</p>
Our current patch is <a href="http://download.berlios.de/wep-linux/patch-2.4.19-rmk7-pxa1-wep2.gz">patch-2.4.19-rmk7-pxa1-wep2</a> and has these features ready
<ul>
<li>bootable on JFFS2 filesystem</li>
<li>support for 3 Hitachi displays in framebuffer 8bit and 16bit</li>
<li>touchpad support (tested on Xfbdev XFree server)</li>
<li>lcd control driver (supported by our utility)</li>
</ul>
<p>WEP platform has some of the HW equipment already supported by ARM version of kernel,
but not tested by our development team, so we do not recommend to rely to be working properly.
Feel free to report such a functionality or submit your own patches.</p>
<h4>Building instructions</h4>
Place all files into one directory and uncompress 
<a href="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/linux-2.4.19.tar.bz2">linux-2.4.19.tar.bz2</a> with
<pre>
  tar xjf linux-2.4.19.tar.bz2
</pre>
enter linux directory
<pre>
  cd linux-2.4.19
</pre>
and apply all needed patches
<pre>
  bunzip2 -c ../patch-2.4.19-rmk7.bz2 | patch -p1
  gunzip -c ../diff-2.4.19-rmk7-pxa1.gz | patch -p1
  gunzip -c ../patch-2.4.19-rmk7-pxa1-wep2.gz | patch -p1
</pre>
To get apply WEP kernel configuration to your patched sources type
<pre>
  make wepep250_config
</pre>
Optionally you may have to change some setups in kernel by hand.
For example, this config is setup as monolitic kernel, so no
kernel modules are compiled. Also setting framebuffer to type
of your display is neccessary. Do
<pre>
  make menuconfig
</pre>
If sources are properly setup and you have arm-linux-gcc named cross compiler
available you may type
<pre>
  make dep;make
</pre>
Hopefully a result vmlinux.bin file is placed in the direcory. For use
with U-Boot loader you need to create U-Boot image file type like this
<pre>
  mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -a a0008000 -e a0008000 -C none vmlinux.bin uImage
</pre>
"mkimage" is tool compliled with U-Boot compilation. More intructions about
loading image into U-Boot see our U-Boot help <a href="uboot.html">page</a>.
