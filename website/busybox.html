<p>The BusyBox was started as project for simplier creation so called rescue disks.
Its maing goal is it to provide all neccessary tools to be able autonomnly operate
on Unix kernel. This includes shells, file-utils, compress utils and many more components
presented in real Unix system world. In fact BusyBox provides all of its functionality
with one and only executable and many links presenting real commnads like 'ls','chmod',
'date' or 'dd'. Of course, all implemented commands has very limited features to keep
BusyBox small. That's why rescue disks likes it.
</p>



<p>Untar BusyBox and edit 'Config.h' file located in root of project directory. Carefully
pick up commands and features you need to have or like to have (remember this commands
have only very limited implementation) and decide if you later on will replace
BusyBox implementation with real version of command.
</p>
To build type
<pre>make CROSS=arm-linux-</pre>
if your cross compiler has "arm-linux-" prefix.
You may also find usefull 'install.sh' script that installs BusyBox with all links
in defined directory.
<pre>./install.sh ../image</pre>
<p>BusyBox is one and only sofware component you will need to test your Linux on WEP platform.
Because WEP kernel patch expects to boot root filesystem from JFFS2 filesystem
located in FLASH memory on address 200000 (hexa), to use freshly compiled BusyBox you will
need to create a filesystem binary file.
</p>
To get JFFS2 binary file use mkfs.jffs2 tool from MTD devices.
<pre>
mkfs.jffs -o wep-start.jffs2 -e 256 -p
</pre>
Probably worth to be mentioned is the parameter "-e 256", that instructs mkfs.jffs2
create structures suitable for WEP FLASH memory configuration.
